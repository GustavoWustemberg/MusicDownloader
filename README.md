# Music Downloader
This project aims to allow the user to download music from YouTube Music for free and safely. The idea arose from the need to find a reliable solution to download music on your computer, as the available options could often represent risks to the system's security.

This script automates the music download task and guarantees user safety, without the need to resort to software that could compromise the integrity of the computer. With it, you can access your favorite songs quickly and conveniently.

The process of using the script is simple: just add the URL of the song you want to download and choose the download option. If there is an error in the download, the script will inform the user and proceed to the next song. The script also has the option to exit if the user does not want to download more songs.

We hope this project is useful and helps make the process of downloading music from YouTube Music easier and safer.
